Everytime we touch i get this feeling, and everytime we kiss i swear i could fly
I need your love, i need your time, when everything is wrong, you make it right
40 days and 40 nights, ive been waiting for a girl like you to come and save my life
It started with a whisper, that was when i kissed her, then she made my lips hurt
